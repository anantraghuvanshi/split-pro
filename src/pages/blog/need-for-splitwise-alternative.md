Splitwise doesn't need an introduction. It's a popular app for managing shared expenses. It's advertised as a free tool but they slowly started charging money for very basic features like adding more than 3 expenses in a day.

Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with products charging money. After all, splitwise is a very good product and lot's of effort has been put on the product. But the problem is locking you after you've used the product for a long time and charge for features that doesn't convert to the value they provide.

I will happily pay for the pro features, but this really frustrates me.

## I'm not alone

As you guessed this created a ripple over the internet. I'll list few comments from the internet.

## Okay, what now?

Creating an open source alternative is very important now. Any closed source alternative might do the same and I don't have any reason to believe otherwise. This will force us to create a better product and makes it hard to be evil. After all we will have an option to host the solution ourselves.
